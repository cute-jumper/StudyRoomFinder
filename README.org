* StudyRoomFinder
** Overview
   This is a piece of software helping students in Tsinghua University
   to find out available study rooms.
   - A backend parser and database manager: RoominfoParser.py
   - A PyGTK user interface: querygtk.py
   - A J2ME mobile client: *missing*

** Get Started
   Run in terminal:
   : python RoominfoParser.py

   It will result in two files: classroom.db and classroom. The former
   can be used by the querygtk.py, and the latter can be used by the
   mobile client by putting this file under my website's root
   directory.

   Run in terminal:
   : python querygtk.py

   You can get a graphical user interface. Stupid enough!

** Things To Do
   - I will try to find out the missing source file for mobile client.
   - Refactoring, maybe. But I'm not very likely to do this without
     outer motivation.
